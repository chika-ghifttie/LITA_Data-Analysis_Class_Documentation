### Project Title: Pioneer Staff Schedule Analysis

### Project Overview
The project focuses on cleaning and analyzing the Pioneer Staff Schedule Data of 'Just Vacated Limited'. The dataset provided contains names of pioneering staff members and company locations. In this analysis, we seek to extract and clean data, standardize staff names, remove unnecessary spaces and also generate more data to enable us perform basic data analysis.

### Data Sources
The data used for this project was provided by our instructor via our Telegram group for educational purpose. The original source of the data is in the form of an Excel file named Text.xlsx.

### Data Cleaning And Preparation
#### Initial Data Limitations And Challenges
  - Only staff name and location were provided
  - Names scattered with inconsistent format (Block Letters, Mixed Case)
  - Unnecessary spaces in names
    
    INITIAL DATA TABLE (Dirty Data)

    #### Cleaning Steps
    To ensure a robust dataset and to facilitate analysis, I performed the following cleaning steps:
      - *Addressed scattered formatting and unnecessary spacing in names,*
      - *A realistic Salary Data was also generated as this was not available in the original Dataset. This was achieved by using Excel's "RAND" Function.*

        ### Exploratory Data Analysis
        This has to do with exploring of data to answer some questions about the data. The Staff Data was explored to address inconsistencies and answer key questions such as :
        - What is the Total No of Staffs?
        - What is the Average Salary of Staff?
        - What is the Highest Salary of Staff?
        - What is the Fourth Highest Salary of Staff?
